# Acme README 3000

Using the Inquirer package (v.6.5.2), I have created a command-line application that allows the user to dynamically generate a professional README.md file, based on their input, without the usual risk of spontaneous combustion or falling rocks (Caution - do not run near open flames or desert highways).
